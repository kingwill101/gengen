<p>
  Willsthoughts is an evolving notebook of technology, culture, and personal observations. It is written
  from Kingston, Jamaica with an eye for the global pulse—highlighting voices, tools, and trends that
  deserve a closer listen.
</p>

<p>
  On any given week you might find deep dives into developer workflows, sonic journeys through dancehall
  history, or notes from current experiments in open source. The goal is to spark curiosity, encourage
  thoughtful debate, and keep a record of the lessons learned along the way.
