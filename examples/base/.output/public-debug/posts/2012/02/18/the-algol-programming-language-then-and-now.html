    <h3>The ALGOL Programming Language-then and now</h3>
    <p><p><img src="/assets/images/ALGOL.jpg" alt="Algol" /></p>
<p>The ALGOL(Algorithmic Programming Language) developed in the mid 1950’ s with the aims of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creating a a language for scientific computation.</li>
<li>A language that was machine independent.</li>
<li>A universally accepted Programming Language.</li>
<li>Being the first language that Addressed the issue of software portability.</li>
</ul>
<p>All these goalswere acheved by an international Committe in the late 1950s’ in a report entitled Algol58 followed by
other reports etitled Algol60 and Algol68 respectively .Like many other languages it had a few problems here and there:</p>
<ol>
<li>Although machine independence enabled developers to be more creative it made implementing more difficult.</li>
</ol>
<p>Despite the fact that the commercial populatrity of the Algol Family was not as great as other languages in its time
such as Cobal and Fortran, but you could say that its algorithmic structure was, which made it the most important
language of its time.</p>
<p>Languages which were later developed after(B,C,CPL,Pascal,ADA just to name a few)were all influenced by the ALGOLfamily
in some way or the other for example:</p>
<ul>
<li>The use of dynamic arrays</li>
<li>Reserved Words</li>
<li>User Defined Types</li>
</ul>
<p>As well as other ALGOL like syntax patterns .</p>
<p>So with that we hail the original implementers of the ALGOL language for if it wasnt for them most of these languages
that we have come to love wouldnt be.</p>

<p>I'm no tech head but I get the point of this blog,I'm here typing this and listening to music at the same time, if it
was not for the original creators of the algorithm all this probably wouldn't be possible. So for all you out there
enjoying the benefits of 2 and forgot that you first need 1 you need to talk a closer look at this brother is saying.
Hail to the original implementers of the algorithm for it was they who set all this in motion.</p>
