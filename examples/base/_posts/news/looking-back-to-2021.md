It is now a new year, 2022 to be specific and I cannot help but think back to all the things that happened during this past year. From finishing my first year in college to finally diving into the world of rust programming. 2021 was what some would call a rollercoaster of a ride.

Covid constantly presented new challenges which required us to rethink how we live and interact with each other. Many of us lost the ones we loved, whether from covid or through natural causes. For some of us, losses came in other forms, long-lasting friendships being destroyed, losing that one job you thought was secure or for some having to permanently close the doors to the business they built from the ground up.
This turned out to be a blessing in disguise for others. You’d never have started that clothing line that you dreamt of setting up for many years and your entrepreneurial spirit would never have been ignited.

Personally, my journey throughout 2021 was a mixture of positives and negatives. I mentioned earlier that I finally completed my first year in college. Since leaving high school, I have registered and started degree programmes at three different institutions. With each try, I never got past the first semester. If you ask me why, I probably wouldn't be able to give a direct answer. However, to summarize, I'll blame it on having the attention span of a cockroach, an issue I have suffered with throughout my professional career.

At [EduFocal](https://www.edufocal.com) we finally expanded our team of engineers, and things have taken off. Having fresh eyes to look at the work you've done puts a lot into perspective. How do you onboard new developers? Will you have to sacrifice valuable engineering hours to get their local environment running? How about documentation and testing? These are some of the areas I spent a bit of time exploring throughout 2021 and while I may not have all the right answers, I'm confident I know a lot more than I did a year ago.

Outside of work, I finally decided to learn the [rust programming language](https://www.rust-lang.org). If you are not aware, rust is a c++ like programming language that was designed from the ground up by Mozilla to be memory safe. Usually, the first thing I do when attempting to learn a new programming language, is start to with a project. This time I chose to create [rustybrain](https://github.com/kingwill101/rustybrain), an attempted reimplementation of [Gbrainy](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/gbrainy). The app uses a mixture of rust for the core and dart (flutter) for the user interface. Even though I'm still trying to wrap my head around Rusts' borrow checker, I've been having lots of fun.
