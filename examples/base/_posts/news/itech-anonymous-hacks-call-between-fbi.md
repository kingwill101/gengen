[iTech: Anonymous hacks call between FBI and Scotland Yard...](http://itechnopedia.blogspot.com/2012/02/anonymous-hacks-call-between-fbi-and.html?spref=bl):   
 Anonymous hacks call between FBI and Scotland Yard...: A recent trans-Atlantic call between the FBI and the UK's Scotland Yard in which operatives from the two law enforcement agencies were discussing current matters involving several hacker groups was intercepted by the hacker group Anonymous and posted to the web after editing.  
  
  

Anonymous over the past several months have been hacking into and defacing websites mostly owned by government in protest to the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA).The Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) is a multi-national agreement for the purpose of establishing international standards for intellectual property rights enforcement. The agreement aims to establish an international legal framework for targeting counterfeit goods, generic medicines and copyright infringement on the Internet, and would create a new governing body outside existing forums, such as the World Trade Organization, the World Intellectual Property Organization, or the United Nations.

  

Some of the sites already hacked by the group Anonymous are -The Trade Commission(most recent at the time this blog was written), CIA, Department of Homeland Security just to name a few.
