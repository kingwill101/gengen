Growing up in Jamaica, I was naturally exposed to Reggae from an early age. 
Reggae music on a whole, is the expression of our everyday life, what we see, hear and talk about. 
It's an amalgamation of our ancient roots , traits passed down through the descendants of slaves 
and freedom fighers, spiritual and great tribe leaders from the great planes of Africa. 


For every great reggae tune there is the shadow of a heroic spirit, 
ancestors watching over and guiding it's descendants, never Letting them forget where they came from.


So if you ask me what my favorite genre of music is, without a doubt, my answer is always gonna be reggae.
