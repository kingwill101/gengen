    <h3>Ode to Reggae</h3>
    <p><p>Growing up in Jamaica, I was naturally exposed to Reggae from an early age.
Reggae music on a whole, is the expression of our everyday life, what we see, hear and talk about.
It's an amalgamation of our ancient roots , traits passed down through the descendants of slaves
and freedom fighers, spiritual and great tribe leaders from the great planes of Africa.</p>
<p>For every great reggae tune there is the shadow of a heroic spirit,
ancestors watching over and guiding it's descendants, never Letting them forget where they came from.</p>
<p>So if you ask me what my favorite genre of music is, without a doubt, my answer is always gonna be reggae.</p>
