    <h3>Ubuntu: unresponsive touchpad at login</h3>
    <p><p>I have been a Linux user for many years and now and then I come across an issue that I've never seen.</p>
<p>My current Ubuntu install has been around for about 6 months and recently I noticed that my touchpad no longer worked
whenever I got to the login screen.
This I assume came about as a result of me switching between desktop environments (installed KDE for about a month now).
The issue persisted between gdm and sddm which felt a bit weird, usually i find that switching between display managers fix these weird quirks.
To cut a long story short, after doing a bit of research I found the following xorg config that ended up solving all my
touchpad issues.</p>
<p>For my system <code>lsb_release -a</code> returns</p>
<pre><code>No LSB modules are available.
Distributor ID: Ubuntu
Description:    Ubuntu 20.10
Release:        20.10
Codename:       groovy
</code></pre>
<p>and <code>uname -ar</code> returns</p>
<pre><code>Linux kingwill101-Inspiron-5491-2n1 5.10.7-051007-generic #202101122046 SMP Tue Jan 12 21:13:32 UTC 2021 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux
</code></pre>
<p>Not sure if my situation is unique in any shape but hope the solution works for you as well.</p>
<h2 id="solution">Solution</h2>
<p>Save the following to <code>/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/20-touchpad.conf</code></p>
<pre><code>Section "InputClass"
        Identifier "libinput touchpad catchall"
        MatchIsTouchpad "on"
        MatchDevicePath "/dev/input/event*"
        Driver "libinput"

        Option "Tapping" "on"
        Option "NaturalScrolling" "on"
        Option "MiddleEmulation" "on"
        Option "DisableWhileTyping" "on"
EndSection
