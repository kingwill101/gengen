<p>Recently i was on <a href="http://techjamaica.com/">techjamaica</a> in their forums where im a regular and one of its members posted a video of persons being being tricked into thinking that what they were testing out was the new iPad 3 which really were iPad2s, check it out <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5894094/we-people-an-ipad-2-told-them-it-was-the-new-ipad-and-they-loved-it?tag=ipad">here</a> .</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>What fellow posters in the the thread and i kept talking about is how Apple is able to reproduce the same iDevices with not much major changes to the hardware or software and continue to reap a lot from it, but as usual there are always going to be devoted apple fans that hate  when you talk the truth. I might sound as if i hate Apple but i dont,  in fact i love using there products.Then what is the reason for this post ?..it is merely just to give users of these products a heads up when upgrading to the "latest".</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><strong>Reasons to get an iPad 3:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You never had a device made by Apple.</li>
<li>You care about performance and for you the iPad 1 or 2 just wasn't cutting it.</li>
<li>You care about hardware and you love the fact that it is built to last.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Reasons not to:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Just because its the latest and all your friends are doing the same.why would you want to do a thing like that when you barely have gotten use to your iPad2?</li>
<li>You want to save money.There are lots of great tablets out there that im sure can do the same as the iPad or even better and it is way cheaper(note: again im not an Apple hater).</li>
<li>Its just too early to buy a new iPad and your iPad2 dosnt even have a scratch on itso why not wait on the next release which  probably will be in another year or so.</li>
</ul>
