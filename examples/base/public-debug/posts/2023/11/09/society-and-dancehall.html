    <h3>Society and Dancehall</h3>
    <p><p>Jamaicans have a tendency of shifting the goal post of where blame should be attributed. One of, if not the most popular, is the argument that dancehall music is the reflection of the Jamaican society rather than the reflector that blinds the eyes of the easily influenced.
This argument in my opinion is very shallow. Yes, in the earlier days that may have been how it started. The political climate in the 70s and 80s, significantly contributed to crime and violence. Many area leaders came into being controlling/leading different communities and factions. An era <a href="https://www.waterstones.com/book/an-introduction-to-politics/trevor-munroe/9789768125798">well documented</a> by political experts way more qualified than I am. Not being able to do much, musicians back then started singing about what happened.</p>

<p>Bob Marley in 1978 famously <a href="https://jacobin.com/2021/06/bob-marley-jamaica-peace-concert-photo">brought on both political leaders</a>, Michael Manley(PNP) and Edward Seaga(JLP) on stage at the One Love Peace Concert in Kingston. A move seen as him suing for peace among the parties and their supporters.</p>

<p>That was then, but what about now?</p>
<p>I often joke about the idea of Jamaica itself being a huge echo chamber, we only see Jamaica and not the wider world. A fun thought is the "island wars" that take place on social media every now and then, Jamaicans deem themselves the crown jewel of the Caribbean(We are 🙃 ).</p>

<p>We only repeat what is released by certain political elements. We only talk about what the media has in store for us this week. Never truly understanding how vulnerable a place we are in. Yes, the same can be said about other countries/jurisdictions.</p>
<p>Maybe we are too far inside the chamber to logically think about the issues at hand.</p>
<p>For decades, researchers have extensively documented how music affects individuals and society on a whole. Historically, the influence of music has been noted by thinkers like Plato, who attributed music with the power to shape the personality of its audience and to serve as an educational tool that could reinforce positive human characteristics [1]. Modern research continues to explore and validate music's significant impact on society, including its potential effects on disease, depression, expenditure, productivity, and general outlook on life, with neuroscience advancements enabling a deeper understanding of music’s impact on the brain [2].</p>
<p>Ironically it is plain to see that the said description matches what Reggae music has consistently done since it’s inception. So why is it hard for us to give in and admit that Dancehall culture has negatively impacted our society? Don’t get me wrong, beyond the violent personas that get the most voice. There is still the legacy of the overachievers, the fore bearers that brought Dancehall culture to the world. The fore bearers that made sure the world appreciated the pure essence of Dancehall culture and what it was truly meant to be.</p>

<p>An interesting era in Jamaica's history , circa 2004-2010.  The period i went through high school. High school is where my understanding of Dancehall culture truly started. Admittedly i grew up in an environment where i only ever heard my father playing reggae music that originated in the early 60's up until the late 90's, and of course the obligated healthy dose of gospel music that most Jamaicans listened to on a Sunday morning.</p>
<p>Commute for me was home-school-home, home-church-home never truly being able to interact with elements outside of said spheres.  That changed on the first day of high school, having to now commute to a different parish I only ever visited once for orientation. Transportation came via a mini bus or the dedicated metro that went directly to school.
I now had to experience what society was truly like, if you have ever had to travel anywhere in Jamaica via the same methods, you will definitely understand the meaning behind my words.</p>

<p>Interestingly, within the same period we got the Gaza vs Gully feud between Vybz Kartel and Movado. Day after day traveling to and from school I could look forward to hear the next installment of a response from either side. We got a lot of interesting lyrics, arguably 80% of said lyrics were about committing murders. My fellow classmates pitted themselves against each other, declaring their allegiance to Gully or Gaza. Said feud eventually led to the government having to  intercede bringing both sides to Jamaica house.</p>
<p>Vybz Kartel On the “lighter” side of things (see what i did there), went on to do bigger things.  He arguably <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CFYtre2q6uo">single-handedly revived</a> the love of the <a href="https://www.clarks.com/en-gb">Clarks</a> brand in Jamaica. Within a month of the release of “Clarkes” half my classmates had their own dessert clarkes.</p>
<p>Kartel at it again released <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwfooWHxymk">cake soap</a> a song glorifying <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmY0_l6BNPc">skin bleaching</a> and that also resulted in fellow schoolmates always having a  bar of cake soap. Every chance they get, you’ll see them at the bathroom washing their face.</p>

<p>Beyond Vybez Kartel, whom there is now arguably exists a cult of personality. We can look to more modern examples.
Let’s look at Dancehall artiste Brysco. In April 2022,  released 'Code'.

Ignoring the lyrics glorifying criminal activities, the song makes reference to “back road gyal suck it with the ensure”. Beyond the nonsensical nature of said lyrics and sexualization of a nutritional drink, we now have students on camera simulating sexual acts based on the lyrics, grown women in the dancehall on camera in compromising situations.

<p>In my mind there are many more scenarios that i can write about, from songs promoting chopping (scamming) to songs glorifying being dunce.</p>
<p>To wrap up I can only ask 2 questions.</p>
<p>When will we hold ourselves accountable and at what point do we step outside of the echo chamber,  and have a look from the outside.</p>
