<p>Anonymous over the past several months have been hacking into and defacing websites mostly owned by government in protest to the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA).The Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) is a multi-national agreement for the purpose of establishing international standards for intellectual property rights enforcement. The agreement aims to establish an international legal framework for targeting counterfeit goods, generic medicines and copyright infringement on the Internet, and would create a new governing body outside existing forums, such as the World Trade Organization, the World Intellectual Property Organization, or the United Nations.</p>

<p>Some of the sites already hacked by the group Anonymous are -The Trade Commission(most recent at the time this blog was written), CIA, Department of Homeland Security just to name a few.</p>
