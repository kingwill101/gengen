```javascript
function optimizePerformance(data) {
 return data
 .filter(item => item.isValid)
 .map(item => transform(item))
 .reduce((acc, item) => acc + item.value, 0);
}
```

Modern tools and frameworks make this process much more efficient. Best practices have evolved significantly over the past few years. Testing and validation are essential components of any robust solution.
