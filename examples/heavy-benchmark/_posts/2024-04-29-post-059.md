## Implementation Details

```dart
Future<void> processData(List<String> items) async {
  for (final item in items) {
    await processItem(item);
  }
}
```

Performance optimization should be considered from the early stages. Maintainability and code quality are long-term success factors. Security considerations must be integrated throughout the development process.
