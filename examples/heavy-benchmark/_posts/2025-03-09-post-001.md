Maintainability and code quality are long-term success factors. Testing and validation are essential components of any robust solution. The implementation details require careful consideration of performance implications.

## Implementation Details

```python
def analyze_performance(dataset):
    results = []
    for record in dataset:
        processed = process_record(record)
        results.append(processed)
    return results
```
