Security considerations must be integrated throughout the development process. Modern tools and frameworks make this process much more efficient. This approach provides significant benefits for modern development workflows. Understanding these concepts is crucial for building scalable applications.

## Implementation Details

```javascript
function optimizePerformance(data) {
  return data
    .filter(item => item.isValid)
    .map(item => transform(item))
    .reduce((acc, item) => acc + item.value, 0);
}
```
