## Implementation Details

```javascript
function optimizePerformance(data) {
  return data
    .filter(item => item.isValid)
    .map(item => transform(item))
    .reduce((acc, item) => acc + item.value, 0);
}
```

Best practices have evolved significantly over the past few years. Security considerations must be integrated throughout the development process. Maintainability and code quality are long-term success factors.
