Testing and validation are essential components of any robust solution. Understanding these concepts is crucial for building scalable applications. Testing and validation are essential components of any robust solution. Best practices have evolved significantly over the past few years.

### Code Example

```javascript
function optimizePerformance(data) {
  return data
    .filter(item => item.isValid)
    .map(item => transform(item))
    .reduce((acc, item) => acc + item.value, 0);
}
```
