# Tailwind CSS is automatically processed by the TailwindPlugin
# The plugin will look for:
# - Input file: assets/css/tailwind.css (by default)
# - Tailwind executable: ./tailwindcss (by default)
# - Output file: assets/css/styles.css (by default)

# You can customize these paths if needed in your own plugin configuration
