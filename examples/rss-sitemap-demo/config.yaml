# RSS and Sitemap plugins are automatically enabled
# They generate:
# - RSS feed at /feed.xml (20 most recent posts by default)
# - XML sitemap at /sitemap.xml (all pages and posts)

# You can customize the plugins by adding them manually to your site
# if you need different settings than the defaults
