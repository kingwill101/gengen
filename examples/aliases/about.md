# About TechCorp Solutions

**Formerly OldTech Inc** - We rebranded in 2024!

## Our Story

TechCorp Solutions (formerly OldTech Inc) has been providing innovative technology solutions since 2010. We recently rebranded to better reflect our expanded services and modern approach.

## Why We Use Aliases

When we rebranded from "OldTech Inc" to "TechCorp Solutions", we had many existing links and bookmarks pointing to our old company pages. Instead of breaking these links, we used GenGen aliases to ensure all old URLs still work.

### Old URLs That Still Work:

- `oldtech-inc.html` - Our old company name
- `old-company.html` - Generic old reference  
- `company-info.html` - Previous page name
- `who-we-are.html` - Alternative description
- `team.html` - Team page redirect

## Our Services

- Web Development
- Mobile Applications  
- Cloud Solutions
- Digital Consulting
