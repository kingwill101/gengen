# Welcome to the GenGen Aliases Example!

This example site demonstrates how **aliases** work in GenGen. Aliases allow you to create multiple URLs that point to the same content.

## What You'll See Here

This site contains several pages that showcase different alias patterns:

- **Homepage** (this page) - Available at multiple URLs
- **About Page** - Shows company rebranding scenario
- **Blog Post** - Demonstrates migration from another platform
- **Contact Page** - Shows multiple access paths

## How Aliases Work

When GenGen builds this site, it creates identical copies of each page at all the alias locations. This means:

1. The same content appears at multiple URLs
2. All URLs are fully functional (not redirects)
3. Perfect for maintaining backward compatibility

## Try It Yourself

After building this site, you can access this homepage via:

- `/` (main URL)
- `/home.html` (alias)
- `/welcome.html` (alias) 
- `/start.html` (alias)

All these URLs will show the exact same content!
