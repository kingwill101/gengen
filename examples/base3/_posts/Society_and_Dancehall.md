Jamaicans have a tendency of shifting the goal post of where blame should be attributed. One of, if not the most popular, is the argument that dancehall music is the reflection of the Jamaican society rather than the reflector that blinds the eyes of the easily influenced.
This argument in my opinion is very shallow. Yes, in the earlier days that may have been how it started. The political climate in the 70s and 80s, significantly contributed to crime and violence. Many area leaders came into being controlling/leading different communities and factions. An era [well documented](https://www.waterstones.com/book/an-introduction-to-politics/trevor-munroe/9789768125798) by political experts way more qualified than I am. Not being able to do much, musicians back then started singing about what happened.
