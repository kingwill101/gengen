# Examples

Use these example sites as starting points or references when building your own GenGen site.

## Example directories

Check the `examples/` directory in the GenGen repository for complete working examples:

- `examples/base/` — Basic site setup
- `examples/pagination/` — Pagination configuration
- `examples/aliases/` — URL aliases and redirects
- `examples/collections-demo/` — Collections with nested content

## What to look for

- **Configuration patterns**: See how `_config.yaml` is structured across examples.
- **Content layout**: Learn how posts, pages, and collections are organized.
- **Themes & assets**: Explore how themes and Sass assets are wired.

If you have a scenario you'd like covered, open an issue and we can add a new example.
