# Deploy to GitHub Pages

GitHub Pages can serve the `public/` directory generated by GenGen. Common approaches:

1. **GitHub Actions** – use the official `actions/deploy-pages` workflow to build and publish on push.
2. **Manual publish** – build locally with `gengen build` and push the `public/` folder to the `gh-pages` branch.

## Sample Workflow

```yaml
name: Deploy
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: dart-lang/setup-dart@v1
      - run: dart pub get
      - run: gengen build docs
      - uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v2
        with:
          path: docs/public
  deploy:
    needs: build
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      pages: write
      id-token: write
    environment:
      name: github-pages
      url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}
    steps:
      - uses: actions/deploy-pages@v2
