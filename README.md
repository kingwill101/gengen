In progress static site generator written in dart.

The aim is to implement enough to migrate my blog currently being generated using hugo

### Why another static site generator

Just for the fun of it.. actually I'm too lazy to figure out why hugo isn't working again on my blog. 

Joke aside, Hugo is a great tool which I've successfully used for the last 3 years. 

### Usage

Currently we are only able to generate indexed pages per post with initial templating support
using liquid templates.

```agsl

Usage: gengen <command> [arguments]

Global options:
-h, --help    Print this usage information.

Available commands:
